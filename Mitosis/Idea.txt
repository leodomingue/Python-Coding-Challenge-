The program's idea is to recreate cells in Pygame that can simulate mitosis.

1) Recreate background:
Firstly, I need to capture images under a microscope and observe the pixel distribution to recreate an appropriate background.

2)Recreate Cells:
I need to observe cells to understand the pixel distribution and composition in order to recreate the cell accurately.

3) Cells Movement
I must implement random movement that appears natural and not erratic.

4) mitosis
There should be a touch function that allows touching a cell to trigger division into two parts, with the tangent vector (the velocity vector) doubling its speed. 
This action will result in one part of the cell moving in the same direction as before while the other moves in the opposite direction.
